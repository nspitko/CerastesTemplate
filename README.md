# Cerastes Template

This project is designed to show off the basics of [Cerastes](https://github.com/nspitko/cerastes). Currently it just makes the thing minimally run. I'll add more later, maybe.

Note that you probably want to use the Lix package manager here, I've included the hxmls accordingly.
